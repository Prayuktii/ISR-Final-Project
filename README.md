# ISR-Final-Project
The project "**Optimizing Movie Recommendations with PageRank Integration in Recommendation Systems**" aims to improve movie recommendation accuracy by integrating the renowned PageRank algorithm. Drawing from graph theory and recommendation systems principles, this initiative centers on refining movie suggestions' relevance. By implementing PageRank—widely recognized from Google's search ranking—the objective is to elevate the recommendation process. Integrating PageRank enables evaluating movie relationships within a network, offering more curated suggestions based on movie interconnections rather than just individual preferences. This project investigates adapting PageRank, a proven web page ranking tool, to refine movie recommendations, potentially transforming current recommendation systems' precision and customization.
